    <span style="font-weight: 700;">Ans:</span> var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and
    const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated
    but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.But while var variables are initialized
    with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized. While var and let can be declared without being
    initialized,const must be initialized during declaration
